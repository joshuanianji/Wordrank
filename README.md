# WORKRANK

An application that ranks words based on usage.

You can upload your own text file or type in your own text.

## How to use

Either run it yourself or try it [on my website](http://joshuaji.com/wordrank)

If you want to run it yourself,
[this documentation](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html) should help.

But for a quick start, [make sure you have Elm installed](https://elmprogramming.com/elm-package.html). Then run `elm-live src/Main.elm --pushstate -- --output=elm.js` in the command line under the project root. Go to [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) when you're ready to boot it up!
