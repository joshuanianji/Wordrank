# WORKRANK

An Elm application that ranks words based on usage.

You can upload your own text file or type in your own text. 

## How to use

[This documentation](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html) should help lol.

But for a quick start, [make sure you have Elm installed](https://elmprogramming.com/elm-package.html). Then run `elm reactor` in the command line under the project root. Go to [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) when you're ready to boot it up!
